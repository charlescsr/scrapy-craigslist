## Purpose: 
The purpose of Scrapy Craigslist (CL) is
to obtain useful CL apartment data for application-
specific data analysis and representation.

project is a Django-powered project. 

## Requirements:
You will need:

## Craigslist City Codes:

If you need to change the city on the project to harvest 
a different city, please reference [this link](https://sites.google.com/site/clsiteinfo/city-site-code-sort)

still be able to obtain the data from the city of interest.
